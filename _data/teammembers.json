      "rrg": "I moved to Kentucky for the Red. Upstate New York doesnâ€™t have a lot of outdoor rope climbing and I know many people who drive 18 hours round trip to come to the Gorge every year. I get to see some of my old friends when they visit, and I get to explore the walls here every weekend during the season if I can help it. I love the climbing community here and how it extends all over the country too. Not to mention the rock. The rock is beautiful.",

The fun creek crossings, large mossy boulders, and the mystical waterfall at the end of the trail are some of my favorite parts of the hike itself. I highly recommend this trail to anyone looking for a fun adventure in the Gorge!",

Whether I'm surrounded by massive builders in a creek valley or standing 100 feet above the treetops, the gorge always has an overwhelming ability to inspire awe.",
